# What is console?
In TypeScript (and JavaScript), console is a global object that provides functions for writing messages to the browser’s console (in DevTools) or the terminal (when running Node.js).

It’s mainly used for debugging, logging information, warnings, or errors.
# Example:
- let name: string = "Alice";
console.log("Hello,", name); // Hello, Alice

- console.info("Server started on port 3000");

  # Explaination:
  console is a built-in object for logging output.

- Useful for debugging and testing.

- Methods include log, error, warn, info, table, and more.

- Works the same in TypeScript as in JavaScript, but with type safety in TypeScript.

- console.log() is daily use in debugging typescript
